# tasks_C_language

Different complexity tasks and exercisess developed in C language. The structure of the repo is the following:

### 1. Task 1
Simple calculations (equivalent resistors in series and paralell, monthly net salary, trapeze area, piecewise function) 

### 2. Task 2
Simple calculations (2ยบ grade ecuations solutions, IMC) and menus

### 3. Task 3
More complex calculations (special number, secret number, number series) and menus

### 4. Task 4
More complex calculations with functions (person height using gender and tibia lenght values, power values using base and exponent, complex number series or print triangle figures using * symbols)

### 5. Task 5
More complex functions (factorial, trigonometric functions with menu, prime numbers calculation and identification)

### 6. Task 6
Complete tasks using arrays and menus (manipulate info in arrays, count words/letters/vocals inside Strings, arrays inside functions, Strings simple encriptation with ASCII transformations)

### 7. Task 7
Complete tasks with matrix manipulation and functions (transpose, matrix determinant and diagonals, fill matrix and calculate distances, acronyms, magic squares)

### 8. Task 8
Basic use of pointers, wich are variables that store the memory address of an object (pointer declaration, functions with pointers, calculate max&min values inside matrix,2 arrays product)

### 9. Task 9
More complex use of pointers (scalar product of 2 arrays, replacements between 2 strings, prime numbers or in arrays)

### 10. Task 10
Simple functions with structures (read/write data with and without pointers) and development of a simple traffic ticket controlling system

### 11. Task 11
Files maganement (read/write .txt files and improve simple traffic ticket controlling system project including files management as reports)

### 12. Task 12
